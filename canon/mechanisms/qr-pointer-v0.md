# QR Pointer v0

## Purpose

QR Pointer v0 defines a conservative Canon-level mechanism for QR codes before
HODLXXI treats any QR flow as a runtime feature.

A QR Pointer is a discovery pointer to a bounded HODLXXI runtime surface. Its
purpose is to help a human or agent open a verification surface and then verify
signatures, receipts, attestations, policies, delegation records, or runtime
metadata using the target surface's own contract.

QR Pointer v0 is intentionally documentation-only. It does not add a route,
storage table, mutable registry, analytics event, approval flow, delegation
flow, payment flow, receipt issuer, or QR image generator.

## Status

- Status: Canon mechanism proposal.
- Runtime status: not live.
- Endpoint status: no QR Pointer endpoint is added in v0.
- Schema status: no JSON Schema is added in v0.
- Storage status: no pointer storage or database migration is added in v0.

This document describes safety boundaries for future PRs. It must not be read
as evidence that `/qr/<token>` or any QR Pointer runtime route exists.

## Definition

A QR Pointer is:

- a discovery pointer to a bounded HODLXXI runtime surface;
- optionally signed in a future schema;
- optionally revocable in a future schema;
- safe to print only because it does not itself convey authority;
- safe to copy only because replaying it reopens a discovery or verification
  surface rather than creating side effects.

A scan is only a navigation event. The verifier must still inspect the target
runtime surface and verify any signatures, receipts, attestations, policy
records, or delegation records according to their own contracts.

## Non-goals

QR Pointer v0 does not implement:

- runtime routing;
- `/qr/<token>`;
- QR token storage;
- database migrations;
- external QR provider integration;
- QR analytics;
- approval behavior;
- delegation behavior;
- authorization behavior;
- execution behavior;
- payment behavior;
- receipt issuance;
- trust scoring;
- reputation updates;
- audit log creation.

## Safe target classes

A future QR Pointer may point to a bounded public HODLXXI surface when opening
that surface does not itself create authority, consent, approval, payment,
execution, obligation, reputation, or trust.

Conservative safe target classes include:

- `/.well-known/agent.json` for agent discovery;
- `/.well-known/hodlxxi-operator.json` for operator continuity discovery;
- `/.well-known/agent-delegation.json` only after a future PR implements that
  surface;
- `/agent/discovery` for agent discovery metadata;
- `/agent/capabilities` for capability discovery;
- `/agent/verify/<job_id>` for receipt verification discovery;
- `/agent/jobs/<job_id>` only when exposing the job id is privacy-safe;
- `/agent/attestations` for public attestation history;
- `/agent/trust/events` for public trust-event discovery;
- `/agent/reputation` for public aggregate history;
- `/agent/chain/health` for public chain-health discovery;
- `/agent/marketplace/listing` for directory-facing discovery;
- `/agent/skills` for public skill discovery;
- `/agent/delegations/<delegation_id>` only after delegation records exist and
  only when the record is safe to disclose;
- `/agent/attestations/<attestation_id>` only if that addressable attestation
  surface is later supported;
- `/agent/trust/events/<event_id>` only if that addressable event surface is
  later supported;
- `/agent/request/<request_id>` only when privacy-safe and only as a discovery
  surface, not as approval.

## Unsafe target classes

A QR Pointer must not point to a target where a scan or simple HTTP open is
treated as:

- consent;
- approval;
- delegation;
- authorization;
- execution;
- payment;
- receipt issuance;
- attestation creation;
- trust score creation;
- reputation update;
- audit-log creation;
- account login;
- session binding;
- secret disclosure;
- private delegation data disclosure;
- mutable third-party redirect verification;
- unrestricted command execution.

## Explicit non-claims

A QR Pointer does not prove identity.

A QR Pointer does not prove human identity.

A QR Pointer does not prove consent.

A QR Pointer does not prove approval.

A QR Pointer does not prove delegation.

A QR Pointer does not prove authorization.

A QR Pointer does not prove execution.

A QR Pointer does not prove receipt validity.

A QR Pointer does not prove payment.

A QR Pointer does not prove satisfaction.

A QR Pointer does not prove obligation.

A QR Pointer does not prove trust.

A QR Pointer does not prove reputation.

A QR Pointer does not prove human presence.

A QR Pointer does not prove operator approval.

A QR Pointer does not prove that the printed QR was not substituted.

A QR Pointer does not prove that a third-party QR provider is trustworthy.

A QR Pointer is not an audit log.

## Runtime relationship

QR Pointer v0 is a Canon document over existing and planned HODLXXI runtime
surfaces. It does not change current public surfaces and does not advertise a
live QR route.

Existing runtime surfaces remain authoritative for their own contracts,
including:

- `/.well-known/agent.json`;
- `/.well-known/hodlxxi-operator.json`;
- `/agent/discovery`;
- `/agent/capabilities`;
- `/agent/request`;
- `/agent/jobs/<job_id>`;
- `/agent/verify/<job_id>`;
- `/agent/attestations`;
- `/agent/trust/events`;
- `/agent/reputation`;
- `/agent/chain/health`;
- `/agent/marketplace/listing`;
- `/agent/skills`.

Future QR Pointer work must extend existing runtime surfaces where possible. It
must not redefine identity, delegation, approval, receipts, attestations,
reputation, or audit semantics.

## Future endpoint direction

A future PR may introduce a read-only local landing surface such as
`/qr/<token>`, but only after schema and validation tests exist.

If such a route is introduced later, it must:

- be read-only;
- resolve only to an allowlisted bounded runtime surface;
- avoid scan analytics by default;
- avoid external mutable redirects as the verification path;
- fail closed for unknown, expired, revoked, unsafe, or malformed pointers;
- state that scanning does not imply consent, approval, delegation,
  authorization, or trust;
- avoid creating sessions, receipts, attestations, trust scores, reputation
  changes, or audit events merely because a scan occurred.

This PR does not add that route.

## Future JSON schema direction

A future QR Pointer schema should be explicit and minimal. Candidate fields
include:

- `schema`: stable schema identifier;
- `pointer_id`: stable local identifier;
- `target_path`: relative HODLXXI runtime path;
- `target_class`: allowlisted class such as `agent_discovery`,
  `receipt_verification`, or `delegation_discovery`;
- `created_at`: RFC 3339 timestamp;
- `expires_at`: optional RFC 3339 timestamp;
- `revocation_status`: `active`, `revoked`, or `expired`;
- `non_claims`: explicit machine-readable non-claims;
- `privacy_class`: public, pseudonymous, or sensitive;
- `signature`: optional future signature over canonical JSON.

The schema should avoid embedding private identity data, private delegation
data, secrets, bearer tokens, payment credentials, session identifiers, or
third-party mutable redirect state.

## Pointer lifecycle

A future pointer lifecycle should be explicit:

1. Create a pointer record with a bounded target class.
2. Validate the target against the allowlist.
3. Render or export a QR code from the canonical local pointer URL or direct
   safe target.
4. Print or publish the pointer with non-claim language nearby when practical.
5. Verify by opening the target runtime surface and checking its native
   contract.
6. Revoke by marking the pointer revoked in the local registry if a registry
   exists.
7. Audit by reviewing pointer records and target runtime records separately.
8. Roll back by disabling the pointer route or removing the pointer from the
   local registry.

## Revocation semantics

Revocation of a future QR Pointer should mean that the pointer should no longer
resolve as an active discovery link.

Revocation must not be overloaded to mean:

- the underlying identity is revoked;
- a human withdrew consent;
- a delegation is revoked;
- an approval is revoked;
- a receipt is invalid;
- a payment is reversed;
- a trust event is deleted;
- an audit history is erased.

A printed QR code may remain physically available after revocation. Verifiers
must treat printed pointers as stale until the runtime target or pointer
registry confirms current status.

## Privacy rules

A QR Pointer must not contain:

- private delegation data;
- private identity data;
- bearer tokens;
- session identifiers;
- passwords;
- API keys;
- payment secrets;
- invoice preimages;
- sensitive request payloads;
- mutable third-party redirect state required for verification.

URLs should be short, bounded, and minimally identifying. If a future pointer
references a job, request, delegation, attestation, or trust event, the target
must be safe to disclose to anyone who can see or copy the printed code.

## Third-party QR provider rules

Third-party QR providers are optional presentation or printing adapters only.

They must not become part of the HODLXXI trust base.

HODLXXI verification must work without the third-party provider.

A third-party provider must not be required to resolve identity, consent,
approval, delegation, authorization, receipt validity, payment, trust, or
reputation.

Mutable third-party redirects must not be treated as verification. If a provider
URL is used for convenience, the verifier still needs to reach and inspect the
bounded HODLXXI runtime surface.

Private delegation or identity data must not be placed into third-party QR URLs.

## Threat model

### QR substitution

An attacker may replace a printed QR code with another QR code. A QR Pointer
does not prove that the printed code was not substituted. Operators should pair
printed pointers with human-readable domain/path text and encourage verifiers to
inspect the destination domain and runtime signatures.

### Mutable redirects

A mutable redirect can change after printing. HODLXXI verification must not
depend on mutable third-party redirects. Prefer direct HODLXXI runtime URLs or
local pointer records whose behavior is controlled by the runtime.

### Phishing

A QR can send users to a lookalike domain. UI copy should say open verification
surface and verify runtime signatures, not trust the QR.

### Third-party analytics leakage

External QR providers can log scans, IP addresses, user agents, and locations.
Early QR Pointer PRs must not add analytics. Export adapters must be optional
and must not carry private data.

### Scan-as-consent fallacy

Scanning a code is not consent. No runtime behavior may treat a scan as consent,
approval, delegation, authorization, payment, execution, or receipt acceptance.

### Identity laundering

A QR can display a legitimate-looking destination while implying stronger
identity claims than the runtime proves. QR Pointer text must preserve explicit
non-claims and direct verifiers to cryptographic/runtime evidence.

### Stale or revoked printed codes

Printed QR codes can outlive their intended context. Future pointer registries
must support fail-closed expired or revoked states. Verifiers should prefer
current runtime status over printed context.

### Privacy leaks through URL tokens

A URL token can leak through logs, screenshots, browser history, referrers, and
chat previews. Pointer URLs must not contain secrets or sensitive private data.

### Replay and copy risk

Anyone can copy or replay a QR Pointer. This is acceptable only because
replaying it should reopen a discovery or verification surface and should not
create side effects.

### Overclaiming in UI text

Unsafe phrases can make users believe the QR is proof. Avoid phrases such as
trusted QR, verified by QR, scan to approve, scan to delegate, or scan proves
identity. Prefer discovery pointer, open verification surface, verify signatures
and runtime surfaces, scan does not imply consent, scan does not imply approval,
scan does not imply delegation, and scan does not imply trust.

## Operator workflow

### Create

Choose an existing bounded runtime surface. Confirm that opening it is safe for
anyone who can copy the QR. Do not include private data or secrets.

### Print

Print the QR with human-readable destination context and non-claim language when
practical. Avoid text that implies approval, delegation, identity proof, or
trust.

### Verify

Open the target runtime surface. Verify the surface according to its native
contract, such as checking agent metadata, signatures, receipt hashes,
attestation history, or policy/delegation records once those records exist.

### Revoke

If a future pointer registry exists, mark the pointer revoked or expired. If the
QR points directly to an existing runtime surface, revoke or update only the
underlying object according to that object's own contract.

### Audit

Audit pointer creation and pointer registry changes separately from receipts,
attestations, trust events, approvals, and delegations. A scan alone is not an
audit event in v0.

### Rollback

For docs-only v0, rollback means removing or reverting this Canon document. For
a future runtime route, rollback should disable the pointer route or static
pointer registry without affecting existing agent discovery, receipt
verification, delegation, or attestation surfaces.

## Verification procedure

For v0 docs-only review:

1. Confirm this document exists.
2. Confirm it states no runtime endpoint is added in the v0 docs-only phase.
3. Confirm it says a QR Pointer does not prove identity, consent, delegation,
   approval, trust, receipt validity, payment, obligation, or human presence.
4. Confirm no routes, capabilities payloads, database models, migrations, QR
   storage, analytics, dependencies, or external provider integrations changed.
5. Confirm Canon maintenance checks still pass.

For future runtime PRs, verification must additionally prove fail-closed target
validation, no scan side effects, no private-data leakage, and clear non-claim
UI/API text.

## Rollback procedure

For this PR:

1. Revert the commit that adds `canon/mechanisms/qr-pointer-v0.md` and any
   index references.
2. Confirm no runtime files changed.
3. Run the same narrow checks used for this PR.

For future runtime PRs:

1. Disable the QR Pointer route or registry.
2. Keep existing HODLXXI public surfaces available.
3. Preserve audit and receipt history.
4. Publish an operator note if printed pointers may already exist.

## PR roadmap

- PR 1 -- docs/Canon only.
- PR 2 -- JSON Schema and validation tests.
- PR 3 -- read-only local `/qr/<token>` landing surface behind a static pointer
  registry.
- PR 4 -- integrate QR Pointer with `/agent/verify/<job_id>` as a discovery-only
  receipt verification link.
- PR 5 -- integrate with delegation surfaces only after delegation records
  exist.
- PR 6 -- optional external QR provider/export adapter with no trust-base
  expansion.

## Decision gates

Before implementing any QR Pointer runtime behavior, require affirmative answers
to these gates:

- Is the target a bounded runtime surface?
- Does opening the target avoid side effects?
- Does the pointer avoid private data and secrets?
- Does the UI avoid implying identity, consent, approval, delegation,
  authorization, trust, payment, or receipt validity?
- Can verification work without a third-party QR provider?
- Is revocation or expiry behavior explicit?
- Are replay and copy safe because they only reopen discovery or verification?
- Are tests in place before runtime implementation?
- Is rollback possible without changing unrelated public surfaces?
