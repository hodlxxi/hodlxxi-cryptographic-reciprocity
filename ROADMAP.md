# HODLXXI Research Roadmap

## Phase 0 — Foundations (current)
- Establish terminology, whitepaper draft, and formal assumptions.
- Define baseline metrics (LDI, DCR, RCS).
- Publish reproducible simulation scaffold.

## Phase 1 — Model calibration
- Add richer strategy sets (WSLS, stochastic reciprocators, bounded memory agents).
- Calibrate lock-penalty mappings from plausible Bitcoin constraint parameters.
- Add sensitivity analysis over noise, discount factor, and lock horizon.

## Phase 2 — Threat and mechanism hardening
- Extend adversarial models (collusion clusters, sybil farms, exogenous payoff shocks).
- Analyze mechanism modifications (bond sizing rules, staggered exits, quorum attestations).
- Produce falsifiable hypotheses and acceptance tests.

## Phase 3 — Empirical linkage
- Define on-chain/off-chain observable proxies.
- Build ethics-aware data pipeline with privacy boundaries.
- Test whether simulated trends correspond to observed behavior under real constraints.

## Phase 4 — Interoperable research artifacts
- Publish versioned datasets and reproducibility bundles.
- Prepare conference/journal submissions.
- Document external APIs for third-party replication.
