# Theory Overview

HODLXXI frames Bitcoin-constrained capital as a commitment device in repeated cooperation settings.

## Core idea
In repeated games, cooperation relies on expected future value and credible punishment. HODLXXI adds cryptographic commitment by binding a portion of capital to conditions and time.

## What this is not
- Not a moral identity score.
- Not ideological governance.
- Not proof that cooperation always improves.

## Hypothesis framing
**Hypothesis**: if defection creates measurable lock-related costs, the strategic region supporting reciprocity expands for some environments.

## Mechanism channels
1. **Deterrence**: lock penalties reduce one-shot defection appeal.
2. **Signal quality**: long lock horizons may signal commitment type.
3. **Path dependence**: verifiable historical consistency affects partner choice.

## Failure conditions
- If external side-payments exceed lock penalties.
- If identity is cheaply sybilized.
- If liquidity shocks force involuntary deviations.
