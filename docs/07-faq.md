# FAQ

## Is HODLXXI claiming that locked capital guarantees cooperation?
No. The claim is a hypothesis about changed incentive gradients, not a guarantee.

## Is this a moral or ideological scoring system?
No. The framework is mechanism-design and measurement oriented.

## Why use persistent public-key identity?
To connect repeated interactions to verifiable history, enabling strategic conditioning.

## Is this only about Bitcoin covenants?
No. Bitcoin script constraints are the concrete mechanism here, but the formal model is broader commitment-device analysis.

## Are the results already empirically proven?
Not yet. Current outputs are theoretical framing and simulation scaffolding.

## What should contributors add first?
Reproducible experiments, stronger adversarial models, and better falsification tests.
